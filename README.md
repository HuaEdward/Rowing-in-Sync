# Rowing-in-Sync
A Data-Driven Model to Uncover Synchronization Gaps in Rowing Team Performance

# Abstract:

Synchronization is crucial in rowing, where team success hinges on seamless coordination. This study presents a data-driven model to evaluate rower synchronization by identifying motion inconsistencies. Joint coordinates are extracted from video footage using Mediapipe, and a supervised learning classifier generates motion curves by recognizing labeled rowing states. 

Pairwise similarity between these curves is measured using a composite metric, combining Mean Squared Error, Pearson Correlation, and Area Difference. The k-lowest similarity scores highlight the rower most out of sync, ensuring robust and focused analysis.

This framework offers a clear, quantitative method to uncover synchronization gaps, empowering teams to enhance performance through data-driven insights.
